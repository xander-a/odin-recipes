    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>Sinigang na Baboy is a traditional Filipino soup known for its sour and savory taste, typically made with pork, tamarind, and a mix of vegetables. The unique tanginess comes from tamarind, but other souring agents like calamansi or green mango can also be used. It's a comforting and hearty dish enjoyed with rice, perfect for rainy days.</p>
