        <li>
            Marinate the Chicken:
            In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with soy sauce and crushed garlic. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sauté Ingredients:
            Heat cooking oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add chopped onion (if using) and sauté until softened. Then add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they start to brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add Seasonings and Simmer:
            Add vinegar, bay leaves, and pepper. Do not stir right away to allow the vinegar to cook. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add Water and Simmer:
            Pour in water (if desired for more sauce), bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and let the chicken simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adjust Seasoning and Serve:
            Taste and adjust seasoning with salt if needed. Once the sauce has reduced to your desired consistency, remove from heat. Serve hot with steamed rice.
